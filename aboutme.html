I was I am a student who lives in Bintulu City with my family. All my friends are from this city too.I am now did my schooling diploma in a politeknik at the Mukah.
                 <br><br> Now I’m doing my diploma teknologi maklumat( teknologi digital )in this town.<br><br>Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Reading novel & manga is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried reading more difficult book after entering college. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more. After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is listening to music. I started listen the music when I was in middle school, and over the years, the habit has become something that i couldn't lack for.
                <br><br>There are many things I have to learn and want to learn. The first thing that I want to learn is baking. The number of things I can make in the kitchen is limited. However, while making those things, I realize the happiness and satisfaction are get from cooking. One of the cuisines I want to learn correctly is cream puft. It’s a cuisine that I have started loving, and knowing how to cook dishes in the kitchen will make me happy.
                <br><br>Two more things that I want to learn are scuba diving and sky diving. I love doing adventurous things because they make give a feeling of thrill. I want to do professional courses in both the adventure activities.</font></td>
